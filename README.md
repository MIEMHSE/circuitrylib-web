# CircuitryLib Web

**Web interface for CircuitryLib.**

Author: The Profitware Group / Sergey Sobko <S.Sobko@profitware.ru>

The code is mainly written as a part of my very special coursework at Moscow Institute of Electronics and Mathematics (MIEM HSE).

## Introduction

This is a simple web interface for [CircuitryLib](https://github.com/profitware/circuitrylib/).
It is written using Flask and ExtJS. TODO: Make a more detailed description when I have free time.

## Building

From source:

Install the dependencies:

- [CircuitryLib](https://github.com/profitware/circuitrylib/) and its dependencies
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
- [ExtJS 4](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) (should be placed into /static/extjs/)
